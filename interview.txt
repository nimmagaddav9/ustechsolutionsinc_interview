Sr UI Developer - ADP

1. Can you explain your experience working with Angular, React, or StencilJS?

Answer: "I have extensive experience working with Angular and React in my previous roles. 
For Angular, I've worked on creating complex single-page applications (SPAs) using Angular 6+ and 
utilized RxJS for handling asynchronous data streams. 
In React, I've used both class components and functional components with hooks to create dynamic, reusable UI components. 
I've also dabbled with StencilJS for building reusable web components in an efficient and scalable manner. 
These experiences helped me get a solid grasp of TypeScript, JavaScript ES6+, and component-driven architecture."


2. How do you ensure that your code is of high quality?

Answer: "I ensure high code quality by adhering to industry best practices such as writing clean, 
maintainable code with proper naming conventions and code documentation. 
I focus on writing modular code that promotes reusability. 
Additionally, I use automated testing frameworks such as Jasmine or Jest for unit and integration testing, 
ensuring that my code passes rigorous quality checks before it’s deployed. 
I also make use of linting tools to catch potential issues early and perform peer reviews to maintain code quality within the team."


3. What is your experience with testing frameworks like Jasmine, Karma, or Jest?

Answer: "I've worked extensively with Jest for unit testing in my previous roles. 
I use Jest to write test cases for components and services, ensuring they behave as expected. 
I've also used Jasmine in combination with Karma in Angular projects to run unit tests within the browser. 
In both frameworks, I emphasize writing comprehensive test cases that cover edge cases, 
and I also implement mock services for testing components that interact with external APIs."


4. How do you approach building responsive and mobile-first designs?

Answer: "Building responsive applications is something I always prioritize. 
I use CSS3 media queries to ensure that the layout adapts to various screen sizes. 
I also rely on Flexbox and Grid for more complex layouts, which makes building responsive structures easier. 
For mobile-first design, I start by designing the UI for mobile devices and gradually scale up to larger screen sizes. 
I ensure that all elements are easily navigable and perform well across all devices, optimizing the user experience for both 
desktop and mobile users."


5. Can you explain your experience with working on web applications that interface with backend systems via REST APIs?

Answer: "In my previous roles, I’ve worked on several web applications that interact with enterprise backend systems through RESTful APIs. 
I have used Angular's HttpClient to make asynchronous API calls and handle the responses. 
I ensure proper error handling and use RxJS to manage data streams. 
On the client side, I focus on ensuring efficient data handling and smooth user experience, 
while on the server side, I collaborate with backend teams to define the API contracts and ensure data flows seamlessly between
frontend and backend systems."

6. How do you handle asynchronous data flow in your applications?

Answer: "For managing asynchronous data flow, I typically use RxJS in Angular applications. 
RxJS allows me to manage multiple asynchronous data streams with operators like map, mergeMap, and switchMap. 
I use observables for handling data from APIs, user inputs, and other sources, which helps me avoid callback hell and 
improve code readability. I also make use of subjects in RxJS to handle events and data changes across components in a more 
declarative way."


7. Describe a challenging project you've worked on and how you solved it.
Answer: "In one of my previous projects, I was tasked with building a highly dynamic, data-intensive application that needed to 
pull information from multiple enterprise APIs and display it in real-time. The challenge was ensuring that the application could 
handle large amounts of data without degrading performance. To solve this, I implemented lazy loading for components, optimized API
calls by caching results when appropriate, and used RxJS for better state management. 
I also worked closely with the backend team to ensure the APIs were optimized for our needs, which resulted in a significant
improvement in performance and user experience."


8. What is your experience with CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS?
Answer: "I have used both SASS and LESS extensively in my previous projects. 
I prefer using SASS for its powerful features like variables, mixins, and nesting, which allow me to write more modular and 
maintainable stylesheets. I also use SASS for creating a consistent design system by defining global variables for colors, spacing,
and typography. This helps to ensure consistency across the project while making it easier to maintain the styles in large codebases."


9. Can you describe a time when you had to experiment with a new technology or framework? How did you approach it?

Answer: "In my last project, we needed to integrate a new framework, StencilJS, to build web components. 
I had no prior experience with StencilJS, but I approached it by reading the documentation, exploring community examples, and 
working on small proof-of-concept projects. I also collaborated with other engineers who had experience with StencilJS. 
I was able to quickly get up to speed and contribute to the main project. 
This experience reinforced my belief in constantly experimenting with new technologies to stay at the forefront of the field."


10. How do you prioritize and manage tasks in an agile development environment?
Answer: "In an agile environment, I rely heavily on collaboration and communication with my team. 
I participate in daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to ensure everyone is aligned.
When prioritizing tasks, I focus on business needs and user impact. I break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and 
ensure that I am regularly delivering incremental value. I also leverage tools like Jira to track progress and manage time effectively."


11. How do you ensure that your development work aligns with the overall product vision and roadmap?
Answer: "To ensure alignment with the product vision, I make sure to participate in regular product meetings with stakeholders, 
including product managers, designers, and other engineers. I ask clarifying questions to understand the goals behind features,
and I work closely with the team to ensure we are executing within the constraints of the roadmap. 
Additionally, I continuously review the requirements and iterate on features, ensuring we’re delivering high-quality results that
move the product forward."


12. How do you ensure your applications are optimized for performance?
Answer: "Performance optimization is key to providing a smooth user experience. 
I focus on several key areas, including lazy loading modules and components, optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, 
and leveraging browser caching. I also make use of the Angular Change Detection strategy to reduce unnecessary re-renders and 
fine-tune how and when data is loaded. I regularly use tools like Chrome DevTools to monitor performance bottlenecks and adjust 
accordingly."
